# LVGL ported to NXP FRDM-MCXN947

## Overview

This port is intended to use with the NXP FRDM-MCXN947 board. The idea of this project is to provide a quick start to users that have this board to deploy they first
LVGL application to it, by default this project execute the `lvgl_demo_benchmark` where a collection of
widgets get drawn on the display showing the perfomance of the LVGL across different scenarios.

This project is itended to be used with MCU Expresso IDE.

## Buy

The board combo can be acquired from the NXP Direct channel:

## Benchmark

It uses the software based rendering in a single thread mode, in the current optimization
level, it is possible to execute the widgets demo with a value between 30 and 45FPS, while complex container
rendering from the benchmark demo slowdowns to around 10FPS. This is achieved using 16-bit color depth and
extra optimization is done by making the DMA to handle the SPI transfer between the MCU and the LCD.

## Getting started

### Hardware setup
- First of all disconnect all power cables from the board
- Connect the display panel to the board using the header connector J8
- Connect USB cable to the J1 USB-C it provides both Debug port plus console

### Software setup
- You need to install the MCU-Expresso IDE from NXP website:
    * It is avaibalble to Linux, Windows or Mac
    * Refer the link: https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE


### Run the project
- Clone this repository repository
- Open the NXP MCU Expresso IDE:
    * Go to the toolbars and enter in the File menu
    * Then **Import->Existing Projects in the workspace**
    * Navigate to the path where you cloned this repo
    * Then hit OK
- Build the project:
    * On the project explorer do a right click on the imported project
    * Click on **Build Project**
- Run or Debug:
    * First build the project as instructed above
    * On the project explorer do a right click on the imported project
    * Click on the **Debug As...**
    * Select you debug probe configuration it can be:
        * MCU Expresso Link server
        * Jlink Probe
    * Select the discovered probe and then hit Debug
    * The firmware will be downloaded and the debug will be halted on the **main()**
    * just hit **F8** to resume the debuggin
### Debugging
- You can also complement the debug experience with the printf / Console:
    * With the board connected to the host computer find its **COM** number or **/dev/<serial>** node
    * Open your favorite terminal program;
    * Connnect to the serial port found with the following settings:
        * 8 bits
        * 115200 bps
        * No parity
        * No flow control
    * You should now see the logs reported by the demo application while it runs
